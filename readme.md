Currently have various branches with states of implementation. 
Some have scenes representing menus and states of the game, some are just player character demos, while others are enemy demos.

I want to unify these into a better presentable project. 

**However, this is an old project and it's possibly more worthwile to embark on new projects that better showcase what I've learned since 2021...** 



The project at one point was moved to https://github.com/TelloViz/ServerSurfer

Where I was taking it from prototype to full game. Over there, I had a working state system with UI. I'm currently figuring out where to start in my reboot attempt and will possibly start a new repository for a clean go.
