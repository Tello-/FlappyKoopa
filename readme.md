This is a project I worked on in 2021. I am in the process of re-booting it. I'm currently getting re-familiarized with the codebase.

The project at one point was moved to https://github.com/TelloViz/ServerSurfer

Where I was taking it from prototype to full game. Over there, I had a working state system with UI. I'm currently figuring out where to start in my reboot attempt and will possibly start a new repository for a clean go.


Additional:
Currently have various branches with states of implementation. 
Some have scenes representing menus and states of the game, some are just player character demos, while others are enemy demos.

I want to unify these into a better presentable project. I will work on this goal in the time I can find between school and internship preparation (this is part of the prep though)
